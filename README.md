## View Live Preview:

As you type in the editor, the Live Preview section on the right side will automatically update to show how your markdown content is rendered. This live preview helps you see the final output in real-time, making it easier to format your README correctly.

*Saving/Downloading the File*

## Save or Download:

Once you are satisfied with your markdown content, click the Save/Download button at the bottom center of the page. This action will prompt a download of your content as a README.md file, which you can then use for your GitHub repository or any other documentation needs.
